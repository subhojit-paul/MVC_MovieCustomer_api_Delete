1.Difference between Single() and SingleorDefault()
Single() expects one and only one element in the collection.
Single() throws an exception when it gets no element or more than one elements in the collection.
If specified a condition in Single() and result contains no element or more than one elements then it throws an exception.
SingleOrDefault() will return default value of a data type of generic collection if there is no elements in a colection or for the specified condition.
SingleOrDefault() will throw an exception if there is more than one elements in a colection or for the specified condition.
